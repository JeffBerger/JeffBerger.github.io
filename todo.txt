TODOs for the site:

2. There should be like a white circle or oval that grows on mouseover for the navbar
5. Transitions: clicking the navbar should expand the bubble to full screen and then it should fade in the next page
6. Equations need to move around or something, still not clear what they should be doing
7. Background should have something like lines shooting through it randomly or something
8. What about like a radar graph of my skills?
