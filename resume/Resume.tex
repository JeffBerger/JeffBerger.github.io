\begin{itemize}
\item Veteran early-startup full-stack IC and technical manager.
\item I specialize in rapid go-to-market of MVPs as well as complete rebuild of legacy systems and underperforming technical teams.
\item Every position I have had has been at least 50\% IC, leading the technical team and removing blockers from my team members to maximize velocity.

I am a founding team member building out a team of specialists to deploy a quantum ML algorithm as a SAAS product on a rapid timeline. The ML algorithm in python and C have been impelemted by myself as well as several fundamental theoretical extensions of the algorithm, including the pytorch integration and the quantum-hardware prototype of the algorithm.

As the first domestic technical hire I then engaged on a rebuild of the core algorithm-execution system from a C\# monolith to a Python service architecture. The python system decreased the engineer headcount from 30+ consultants to 3 in-house engineers. Execution time for the algorithms dropped allowing much larger and more complicated algorithms. As of 2024 the system was running well over 100x the number of calculations in the same time as the system it replaced with 1/10th the number of engineers.

Hired as the first engineer to build a fantasy sport app from scratch. Built out a team and constructed a service based architecture that served thousands of users executing constrained-integer-optimization problems. The service system was extended to handle data ingestion for a betting product as well as SSO for our customers.
